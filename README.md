OUTPUT EXPLAINED:

notice how Bus's Tesla's and standard cars are all "Cars" and all do things such as Drive, Break, and Refuel, Because of this all of these sub-types of cars take these properties from the car object. As you can see in the case of BUS, a bus drives, breaks, and refuels like a regular car so it inherits all those properties and adds a few more in such as OpenSideDoor() and OpenStopSign(), In the case of a tesla however, it also drives, breaks, and refuels, however this is done in a different way than a normal car. A tesla can self drive and a tesla recharges with electricity instead of refueling with gasoline. Because of this we use POLYMORPHISM or the concept of multiple forms to implement the refueling and the driving methods differently from a regular car while retaining the other properties.
